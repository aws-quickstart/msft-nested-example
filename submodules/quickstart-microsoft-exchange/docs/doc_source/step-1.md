# Step 1\. Prepare Your AWS Account<a name="step-1"></a>

****

1. If you don't already have an AWS account, create one at [http://aws\.amazon\.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) by following the on\-screen instructions\. 

1. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy the infrastructure for Exchange Server on AWS\. If youâ€™re planning to use a third Availability Zone for a file share witness instance or a third Exchange Server node, choose an AWS Region that includes three or more Availability Zones; see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/) for a list\.

1. Create a [key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in your preferred region\. 

1. If necessary, [request a service limit increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase) for the Amazon EC2 **r4\.2xlarge** instance type\. You might need to do this if you already have an existing deployment that uses this instance type, and you think you might exceed the [default limit](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) with this deployment\.
