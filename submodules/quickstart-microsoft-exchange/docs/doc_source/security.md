# Security<a name="security"></a>

AWS provides a set of building blocks \(for example, Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC\) that you can use to provision infrastructure for your applications\. In this model, some security capabilities, such as physical security, are the responsibility of AWS and are highlighted in the AWS security whitepaper\. Other areas, such as controlling access to applications, fall on the application developer and the tools provided in the Microsoft platform\.
